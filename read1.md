# Mastering Markdown

## Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform

## _**What is Markdown?**_

## **Markdown** is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

## You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

## - Gists.
## - Comments in Issues and Pull Requests.
## - Files with the .md or .markdown extension.
## - For more information, see “Writing on GitHub” in the GitHub Help.
