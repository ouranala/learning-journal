# Mastering Markdown

## Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform

## _**What is Markdown?**_

## **Markdown** is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

## You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

## - Gists.
## - Comments in Issues and Pull Requests.
## - Files with the .md or .markdown extension.
## - For more information, see “Writing on GitHub” in the GitHub Help.

## Learning to program with JavaScript involves:
  
  1-Understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them. 
  2-Learning the language itself,and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences.
  3-Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at examples of how JavaScript is commonly used in websites today.
  
  
 ## *A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS*
   
   ### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
   
   
# _**EXPRESSIONS**_

## An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 
    1-EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN AVALUE TO A VARIABLE 
    2-EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN ASINGLE VALUE 

# _**OPERATORS**_

 ## Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

 # _**A FUNCTION**_
 
 ## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
