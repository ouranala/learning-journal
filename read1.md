## Learning to program with JavaScript involves:
  
  1-Understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them. 
  2-Learning the language itself,and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences.
  3-Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at examples of how JavaScript is commonly used in websites today.
  
  
 ## *A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS*
   
   ### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
   
   
# _**EXPRESSIONS**_

## An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 
    1-EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN AVALUE TO A VARIABLE 
    2-EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN ASINGLE VALUE 

# _**OPERATORS**_

 ## Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

 # _**A FUNCTION**_
 
 ## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
