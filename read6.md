## HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER?
  

  ## Before diving into the JavaScript language, you need to know how it will fit together with the HTML and CSS in your web pages.

## 1.Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  ## CONTENT LAYER "_. html files_" 

## 2.Where possible, aim to keep the three languages in separate files, with the HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files.  
  ## PRESENTATION LAYER "_.css files_" 

## 3.Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose. Each layer, from left to right. builds on the previous one.
  ## BEHAVIOR LAYER "_.js files_"
