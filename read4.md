## Who is the Site For?

### Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

## It can be helpful to ask some questions about the people yo would expect to be interested in the subject of your site. If you ask a client who a site is for, it is not uncommon for them to answer "the entire world."

## Realistically, it is unlikely to be relevant to everyone. If your site sells light bulbs, even though most people using a computer probably use light bulbs, they are not likely to order them from someone in a different country.

## Even if the site has a wide appeal, you can still think about the demographics of a sample of the target audience.

# Traditional HTMLLayouts

## For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page
