# _**Introducing How Computers Work**_

 ## The computer does its primary work in a part of the machine we cannot see, a control center that converts data input to information output. This control center, called the central processing unit (CPU), is a highly complex, extensive set of electronic circuitry that executes stored program instructions.

# _**How Information Is Represented Using Electricity**_

 ## Binary is a mathematical number system: a way of counting. We have all learned to count using ten digits: 0-9. One probable reason is that we have ten fingers to represent numbers. The computer has switches to represent data and switches have only two states: ON and OFF.

 # _**How Computers Use Circuits**_

  ## Computer circuitry, Complete path or combination of interconnected paths for electron flow in a computer. Computer circuits are binary in concept, having only two possible states. They use on-off switches (transistors) that are electrically opened and closed in nanoseconds and picoseconds (billionths and trillionths of a second). A computer’s speed of operation depends on the design of its circuitry. Faster rates are achieved by shortening the time it takes to open and close the switches and by developing circuit paths that can handle the increased speeds.

  # **What makes a computer a computer?**

   ## There are basic building blocks to a computer, which, like Lego bricks, can be combined in billions of different ways to make loads of different things. But unlike Lego, these building blocks don’t have to look the same. They could be links on a chain or mechanical gears or pulses of electricity. What they have in common is that they respond to different inputs in different ways.

## 1-Binary manipulation

  ### As you may know, computers take in and give out information in a code called binary. Binary form allows any number to be represented as an arrangement of just two signals which we call 0 and 1. Different types of computers represent 0s and 1s differently: modern computers use a strong electrical pulse for 1 and a weaker one for zero. A billiard ball computer would use a billiard ball as a 1 and the absence of a ball as a zero. However it is represented, each digit within a binary number is called a ‘binary digit’ or ‘bit’.

## 2-Gates

### These blocks are called gates. They take in bits as input, compare them, and output others. This seems very simple – and it is! The complexity and amazing ability of computers comes from combining them. 
 
 # What are the differences between hardware and software?

  ### Computer hardware is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of code installed onto your computer's hard drive. For example, the computer monitor you are using to read this text and the mouse you are using to navigate this web page are computer hardware. The Internet browser that allowed you to visit this page and the operating system that the browser is running on are considered software.

  ### **Further information and examples:**


### All software utilizes at least one hardware device to operate. **For example** , a video game, which is software, uses the computer processor (CPU), memory (RAM), hard drive, and video card to run. Word processing software uses the computer processor, memory, and hard drive to create and save documents.

### Hardware is what makes a computer work. A CPU processes information and that information can be stored in RAM or on a hard drive. A sound card can provide sound to speakers, and a video card can provide an image to a monitor. Each of these are examples of hardware components.
