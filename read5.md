# _Introducing CSS_

## Understanding CSS:
   ### Thinking Inside the Box

## CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
 ## 1.In this example, block level elements are shown with red borders, and inline elements have green borders.
## 2.The <body> element creates the first box, then the <h1>, <h2>,<p>, <i>, and <a> elements each create their own boxes within it.
## 3.Using CSS, you could add a border around any of the boxes,specify its width and height, or add a background color. You could also control text inside a box â€” for example, its color,size, and the typeface used.



## Color can really bring your pages to life.

## *Foreground Color

##  The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

### 1.RGB values

   ### These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For
### Example: _rgb(100,100,90)_

### 2.HEX codes

  ### These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red,green and blue in a color,preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: _#ee3e80_

### 3.COLOR names

   ### There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: _DarkCyan_
